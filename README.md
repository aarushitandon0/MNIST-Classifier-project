# MNIST-Classifier-project

# MNIST Classifier Experiments (a.k.a. Me vs Neural Networks)

> A repo where I figured out how to build MNIST classifiers using Keras `Sequential` models.  
> Contains two mini-projects that helped me learn the basics of neural networks, classification, loss curves, and more.

## What’s Inside
> Each project has it's own readme
### 1. [Digit Classifier (Basic)](https://github.com/aarushitandon0/MNIST-Classifier-project/tree/main/1.%20Handwritten%20Digit%20Classification)

### 2. Swash Classifier (Fashion MNIST)

## Why Two Projects in One Repo?

Both were built while learning the **same thing**: how to make a neural network *do something useful* using the MNIST family of datasets.  
Instead of two separate ghost towns of repos, I put them together here — like a mini evolution of my understanding.

## Tech Stack

- TensorFlow / Keras
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

---

## What I Learned

- How to use the `Sequential` API in Keras
- What activation functions *actually* do
- Overfitting vs Underfitting (and coping with both)
- Using callbacks like `EarlyStopping`
- Plotting loss/accuracy curves
- Debugging weird tensor shapes (send help)

## How to Run

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mnist-classifier-projects.git
cd mnist-classifier-projects

# Open Jupyter Notebooks of the respective project
